# check md5 refs
#
# This script will be used to make sure we never introduce a regression on any
# of the nonregression file.
#
# The approach is relatively simple, we compute a md5sum for each of the decode
# file. Anytime the md5sum is different from the reference one, we assume
# something went wrong and simply fails.  of course if could happen during the
# course of Grok development that the internals are changed that impact the
# decoding process that the output would be bitwise different (while PSNR would
# be kept identical).

# Another more conventional approach is to store the generated output from
# Grok however storing the full generated output is generally useless since
# we do not really care about the exact pixel value, we simply need to known
# when a code change impact output generation. 

# This script expect two inputs
# REFFILE: Path to the md5sum.txt file
# OUTFILENAME: The name of the generated file we want to check The script will
# check whether a PGX or a PNG file was generated in the test suite (computed
# from OUTFILENAME)
