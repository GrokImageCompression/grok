Description: JPEG 2000 image compression/decompression library
 Grok is a library for handling the JPEG 2000 image compression format.
 JPEG 2000 is a wavelet-based image compression standard that permits
 progressive decoding by pixel and resolution accuracy.
 It supports lossless and lossy compression and is resilient to image errors.
 .
 This package contains the runtime files for Grok.

Description: command-line tools for the Grok JPEG 2000 library
 This package provides command-line tools for conversions between
 several image formats:
 .
  - grk_decompress: decompress j2k or jp2 file to pgm, ppm, pnm, pam,
                  pgx, tif, bmp, raw, rawl, jpeg or png.
  - grk_compress: encode pgm, ppm, pnm, pam, pgx, tif, bmp, raw, rawl,
                  jpeg or png file to j2k or jp2 file.
  - grk_dump: dump information contained in a j2k or jp2 file.
